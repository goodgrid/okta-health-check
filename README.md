# Okta Health Check

This project connects to an Okta instance using an Okta API Token beloging to an admin. (Testing with super administrator, but probably read-only administrator is enough). It takes key configuration and events from the API and generates a readable report which can work as the initial version of an end report.

A lot of work is in the docx template. This is managed in Box.

## TO DO

- Add configuration from password policy rules
